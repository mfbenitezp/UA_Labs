    "In this lab, you'll be introduced to fundamental concepts in network analytics while exploring a real-world network dataset. You'll also learn about [NetworkX][1], a library that allows you to manipulate, analyze, and model graph data ( the mathematical form of a network). You'll learn about the different types of graphs and how to visualize them rationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Networks are a useful tool for modelling relationships between entities. Check the slides from Lecture 5 to see the main difference.\n",
    "- By modelling the data as a network, you can gain insight into what entities (or nodes) are important.\n",
    "- You can start to think about optimizing transportation between cities.\n",
    "- Leverage the network structure to find communities in the network.\n",

    "## List comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you have been working using traditional loops that iterate over iterable objects like lists, arrays or data frames. However, that often isn't the most effective way to iterate over an object with multiple items. We can use `list comprehensions` to iterate over Python objects effectively and build queries in one line, rather than a loop that usually involves `.append` methods.  For a detailed  description of list comprehensions, refer to [2] of DataCamp's Python Data Science Toolbox course. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to create a list comprehension, here is a recipe for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `[` *output expression* `for` *iterator variable* `in` *iterable* `if` *predicate expression* `]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your task is to get a **list of nodes** from the graph `T` with the `'occupation'` label of `'scientist'`. You need to loop over the list of nodes (`T.nodes(data=True)`, including the metadata), and then get each value in the list, but only under the conditions that the `occupation` attribute is equal to `scientist`\n",
    "\n",
    "So traditionally, you will be asked to make an empty list, then a For loop, and then use the append to get all the values in the empty list appended.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "noi = []\n",
    "for n, a in T.nodes(data=True): # where a is the attribute we need to filter, and n the nodes.\n",
    "    if a['occupation'] == 'scientist':\n",
    "        noi.append(n)\n",
    "    \n",
    "````\n",
    "Instead of using four lines of code, we can use list comprehensions in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use a list comprehension to get the nodes of interest: noi\n",
    "noi = [n for n, a in T.nodes(data=True) if a['occupation'] == 'scientist']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, it's the same process for the **edges of interest -eoi**; in this case, you are iterating over a tuple, so you need one extra argument. Traditionally, you will have to:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "        eoi.append((u, v))\n",
    "````\n",

    "7. Create interactive maps to plot nodes, edges, nodes+edges and one of the centrality measures.\n",
    "8. Export the street network to a GeoPackage (.gpkg) file. Ensure that the exported file contains both node and edge attributes. Demonstrate that the new GeoPackage can be used and read in Python using any of the libraries we have seen in the class to create a simple and interactive map.\n",
